# Password Generator App

This is a simple password generator application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The application allows users to specify the desired length for a randomly generated password, and it provides a button to trigger the password generation.

## Getting Started

To run the password generator app, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Execute the script, and a graphical user interface window will appear, prompting you to input the desired password length.

## Usage

1. Enter the desired password length in the provided entry field.
2. Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password.
3. A message box will display the generated password.

## Implementation Details

The code uses the Tkinter library for the GUI components and the `random` and `string` libraries for password generation.

### Classes

- **PasswordGeneratorApp:** The main class representing the password generator application. It contains methods to initialize the GUI, handle user input, and generate passwords.

### Methods

- **__init__(self, root):** Initializes the application, creating the main window and UI components.

- **generate_password(self):** Generates a random password based on user input and displays it in a message box.

## Dependencies

- Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- random: Used for generating random values.
- string: Used for working with string-related operations.

## Example

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import tkinter as tk

    # Create the main Tkinter window and the PasswordGeneratorApp instance
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = PasswordGeneratorApp(root)

    # Start the Tkinter event loop
    root.mainloop()
